=== Automated macOS installation for VMs
:talk-name: 2024-installfest-macos-on-vm

*Abstract:*
How to install macOS on a Linux virtualisation infrastructure – from downloading the installer from Apple, through installation, initial setup, customisation and creating a bootable disk image.
And it’s done in a way that Cupertino probably hasn’t even thought of – without the use of a mouse, fully automated with CI.
For comparison, I’ll also show how easy it is to do the same thing with Alpine Linux.
